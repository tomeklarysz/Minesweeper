# Minesweeper

A simple minesweeper game that I wrote because it's one of my favourite games from childhood.

# How to play
A game has 3 levels of difficulty, which can be chosen with buttons on top of the game board.

Easy: 9x9 board, **10 mines** 

Medium: 16x16 board, **40 mines**

Hard: 24x24 board, **99 mines**


Click to expose chosen square of the board, right-click to flag mine.
